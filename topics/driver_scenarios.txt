Driver Scenarios
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the drivers directory, a subdirectory named "scenarios" is expected
by Hodor. The term "scenario" has aspecial meaning. A scenario is
the combination of the "fill_frequency" plus the "fill_type" that a workflow
should execute for. For example, some workflows run hourly, some daily. And
some workflows run over historic ranges of time (i.e. a "backfill"), and some
workflow run for future ranges of time (i.e. "incremental").  So, a driver
can run with a "scenario", which is the combination of the two:

   fill frequency + fill type).

This scenarios that are typically defined are:

  * hourly/incremental
  * hourly/backfill
  * daily/incremental
  * daily/backfill

The scenarios directory, under drivers, defines Oozie coordinators and context
code artifacts that implement the scheduling and variable assignment concerns necessary
to implement the scenario.  A typical scenario is organized as follows


  hourly/
    incremental/
       context.xml
       coordinator.xml    # blocks on time online
       coordinator-1.xml  # blocks on time + 1 data input

For example, the above "hourly/incremental" driver run scenario defines a
coordinator that has an hourly frequency, along with a context.xml workflow that
defines the table partitioning scheme to partition down to hourly granularity
("i.e. an hourly fill_frequency"). The "fill_type" part of the scenario indicates whether
the workflow is running from current time forward, or for historic date ranges.
If running over historic date ranges (i.e. backfill fill_type), certain optimizatons
can be made that run many hours at once.

Each driver cites the run scenario it expects to run within, via the "jobs.yml"
file. For more information about the jobs.yml file, type:
